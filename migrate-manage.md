# Editing your discovered resources
{: #edit-resources}

{{site.data.keyword.vpc-plus-migration}} creates a workspace after discovering your environment. In the workspace you can add, delete, or edit any section of your VPC. For example, you can attach a new load balancer or add a new virtual server instance by clicking the **Add** icon next to _Load Balancers_ and _Instances_. You can also delete items that you do not want to migrate.

To manage your VPCs, select **Manage VPCs** in the navigation menu and choose your **Cloud Account** and **Region**.

You can manage your VPC in a tabular or graphical form by toggling between the two views.

As you proceed to make changes to any component in your VPC, the changes are reflected in your graphical view, which can make it easier to manage and add information or new components.
